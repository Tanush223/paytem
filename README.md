Paytm Full Stack Project
Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed to mimic certain functionalities of the Paytm platform. The project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The backend server is implemented with Express, featuring JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, Zod for input validations, and bcrypt for securely hashing passwords before storing them in the MongoDB database. The frontend is developed using React, Recoil for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
